![This is Leaflet App](https://i.ibb.co/p4cQvGw/Untitled-1.jpg)

This App allows user to create and save popups on a map. Each Popup contains a form, where User can input any data or memo to keep it in future.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

In order to run this App, you should use frontend and backend version of this application. After running, open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
